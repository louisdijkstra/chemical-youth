Chemical Youth Data Sprint
==========================

This repository contains some of the code/scripts and data written and generated during the Chemical Youth Data Sprint. 

## Getting started

The code/scripts in this project are written in Python. We require __Python 3__ to be installed. First, install `virtualenv` (if you haven't already): 

    $ pip install virtualenv 

Create a virtual environment called `chemicalyouth` by typing in the main directory: 

    $ virtualenv -p python3 chemicalyouth
    $ source chemicalyouth/bin/activate

You can now easily install all requirements by typing

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
